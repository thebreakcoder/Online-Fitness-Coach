# Virtual-Fitting-Room
Our idea is to create a virtual try-on technology that may be used in stores or at home. This process will require a "magic mirror" that will display the items for the customer enabling them to change clothes , colors and patterns without the need of getting undressed. The "magic mirror" will be implemented as a TV screen and connected to a computer with a camera. The client will be able to choose an item or more and our main obstacle that we will face is to fit the item correctly on the customer which we will overcome using recognition and  AI modeling that will recognize the joints. Future updates include adding a personalization system that will recommend additional items according to the customer's profile and adding the eligibility for customers to customize their own product.
